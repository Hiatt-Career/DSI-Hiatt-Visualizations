Career paths with a PhD discussed include research, consulting, policy, and data analysis. We also talked about how recent funding cuts in the field are affecting job prospects and graduate training.

Likes excitement of the political world - politics, policy, government
Wants something different than what she's done in the past - does not want to work in a constituent office. Likes working with co-workers, does not want to work with the public.  Policy, legislative policies etc.

It was nice speaking with you as well.  To recap the advice that I suggested today:
1.  When you are asked a question, take a moment to not only think of an accurate answer, but one that will answer the underlying purpose of the question - what is it that they really want to know?  Of course, you could generally consider that they want to know if you can do the job, but each question gets to a particular point - whether it's a skill or characteristic.  When you choose your answer, try to address the reason for the question, not just the literal answer. 
2.  Remember to choose your language carefully - try to avoid casual language (""extracurrics"" v. ""extracurriculars"") and references to something not related to a professional environment (eg: calling someone serious ""uptight"" or if referring to someone as laid back, that they are speaking about hobbies, rather than just a laid back approach).
3.  When using your experience about the group project in an answer, leave out the parts referring to your doing the work for your teammate and that she was an international student.  Instead, focus on how you took the time to talk to her, figured out the problem, and helped her find resources to get the job done!
4.  When we were talking about ""communication style"", I suggested that you talk about being direct, clear, and endeavor to make people feel comfortable.  One way you do this is that you take the time to get to know someone when you can in order to mirror their communication style to make them comfortable - it's not possible to do this with new people, so I think including that you do when possible is important.  Mirroring and tone are not necessarily communication styles.
5.  My version of the ""weakness"" question was to ask you about what might be your steepest learning curve.  At first, you answer focused on learning to be a project manager (in so many words), which is not somethin I would encourage.  Your second answer, which was more focused, was much better, such as learning to use the specific types of technology that they use.  I would also leave out statements that assume that other people have the same understanding as you (""I imagine everyone would need to learn this"")
I hope this helps!  Good luck.

Currently working, will be starting at a clerk's office, and an assistant at an attorney's office.

Discussed difference between internships and work experience post-grad.

Discussed why some people take  time off, and value of working.  Discussed stage of the cycle, and advised on strategy if she applies, and if she waits.  Encouraged her to take an LSAT soon to get an idea of where she is.  Discussed philosophy on taking multiple exams (when it's worth it).

She has already contacted 3 professors re: LOR - discussed how to designate in CAS.  

She said she feels better after we spoke and will wait until next cycle to apply.  She will follow up when she begins preparing other materials.

1.  Does not want to work on weekends
2.  Enjoys flexibility of working from home.

Options:
A.  Commercial - good benefits, but will lose flexibility of working from home.
B.  Kitchen and Bath - similar to what she is learning.  harder to find an employer who won't require weekend work.  May not be as exciting
C.  Residential - doesn't have the financial security (commission based, or she is working for herself)

Also suggested she think about specialties such as closet design - she was interested in speaking to someone who works for California Closets.  Also suggested she look further into whether a commercial company would require a lot of weekend work, as well as companies that organize corporate space.

Spent some time talking about how she makes decisions - likely INFJ.  Trusting her gut is going to feel best to her.  I suggested she think about which of her two priorities are more important, and also realizing that her priorities might change.  Also suggested thinking about which path might allow the most flexibility in terms of transition.  She will consider and make follow up appointment when ready.

Worked for two summers at a firm that did worker's comp- she did not like the work or the firm.  Talked about whether to find a position in or outside the law.  Enjoys working with children - she has been getting notice for positions in education, but not sure that is what she wants to do.  She also mentioned that she could ask her mother for connections, but not sure that it's what she wants (immigration or labor/union) as far as industry or location.  Feels like law is what she knows, and would be easiest to fine.   It explained the importance of identifying preferences when doing a search so that it could yield fewer and more targeted results, whether it's a location or a skill or another key word.  She is open to moving to multiple locations.  She is feeling some pressure because parents will not support her for more than a year.  

To help her fit time in her schedule to look for a job, I suggested making follow up appointment with a goal in mind.  She is going to pick three factors for next job and take a diagnostic LSAT so she knows how much time she needs to plan for studying.

Her questions:  where would she be suited, where can she use her skills? Does not want to go to state government.  Outside of Philly.  Can't rely on politicians and losing her job.  Where can she leverage her skills in health policy and relationships.  Where int he private sector might those skills be useful?  Wants to be deliberate about where she works now.  Wants to do meaningful work.  Policy, partnership, patient advocacy,, access.

Pharma has sectors based on patient advocacy and access.  Has taken advantage classes offered for free with Corsera - AI.  

When she left CDC, when to a law school in CA - did policy research.  Policy jobs she has seen also include lobbying, which she does not want to do. Also, policy research does not pay as much, so not as appealing. 

She has worked on issues related to HIV, formerly incarcerated, immigrants, transyouth.  

Clarified parameters of what we do - help her come up with ideas rather than tell her what to try.  Suggested considering contacting companies that she impacted or were partners in her previous positions in private sector.

I'm so glad we were able to meet and connect.  To get an idea if law, and if specific areas of law, are right for you, there are a host of things you can do:
As discussed, talk to lawyers.  I am happy to chat with you about finding Brandeis alumni in both criminal law and business law.
Since you are interested in exploring criminal law, observe court hearings.  The Waltham Court enjoys having student observers.
Take Legal Studies classes here at Brandeis
Sit in on a law school class - we have several law schools in the area, and if you contact admissions, they are happy to arrange for you to sit in on a class.  
Try internships (more common junior year, and in a law setting, easier if it's with the DA's office, public defender, or a pro-bono services organization like Greater Boston Legal Services or Legal Aid.
Follow cases.  The Karen Read re-trial is starting next week.  Here is a link to Youtube clips of the last trial.
Start there!  Happy to talk more when you are ready.

This would be remote  Dilemma - remote offer is not something she's passionate about.  She has other reservations.  But likely cannot support herself even if she gets the WOW for MCAD.  Intends to let U for FE by next Friday, as she would prefer MCAD.  She just needs to ""get over"" (her words) her sadness of not being at home for the summer.  Advised her that I was unable to give her a more firm date for a WOW decision.

With regard to Mass  Trial Courts, they offered to consider her for the school year.  Confirmed that she can take them up on their offer to consider her without feeling like she is committing - she may want to pursue other in person opportunities.  

That is all she needs for now.

He has an upcoming interview for a retail management internship at Star Market, though he’s unsure whether to accept the role if offered, as he’s concerned it may not offer opportunities to develop new skills. He is also considering working on campus instead, which would give him more time to focus on Python and GRE preparation.

Emphasized the value of having a summer internship after junior year and encouraged him to continue applying. If he is unable to secure an off-campus internship, he should find ways to demonstrate initiative and skill-building, for example, taking on projects to improve workflows in a campus role. Also recommended reaching out to professors for research opportunities (or simply helping a professor with his projects), as this aligns with his interest in economic consulting.

What is it that she wants to pursue, and what re the things that she can do with the skills that she has other than being a software engineer. Thinks she wants to go into product management.  Wants to feel like she's good at her job, and does not feel that way all the time.  Leadership, communication, keep track of tasks, and communicate with engineers.  Can understand enough.  She's been pursuing PM roles - got a certificate in PM form Univ .of MD>  She has been applying, but there are fewer positions.  Also concerned that her resume is not getting looked at, even through referrals.  She's researched positions even in her own company, because got advice that going internally is beneficial.  Concerned she might need to go to grad school.   wants to be a PM for user design/experience.

Disappointment in not getting the promotion was lack of recognition, rather than more responsibility.  

Invited her to think about what a promotion looks like to her, what she wants to learn, grow in her next position.  In her next role - 
She has been working from home.  There is an office Billerica she goes to once a week.  She wants to be able to talk to people! A lot of other people! 
Likes to solve problems.
Wants to feel fulfilled - she is not open to learning another code base, but open to learning about user experience, customers, needs and requirements (front facing). 
Likes being around other engineers, but she doesn't want that to be her every day experience to be.
Could go anywhere.   MA, NY, Chicago. 

Suggested that she tailor her resume so that she can get past ATS, or get feedback as to why she's not getting a phone screen.  She gets plenty of opportunities for software engineer.  Some PM have told her she needs product experience, while others have none. 

She shared that she does not want to spend ""hours"" revising her resume for every job in order to pass ATS - suggested that after she does it for the first one, it is likely that she will only need to tweak it for others, but shared that streamlining applications is something everyone wants to do, and that tailoring is something that every employer is looking for.  

We looked for a a few positions via Google job search, and also referred her to Google's rotational program. 

She noticed that there is an opening at a subsidiary - discussed strategy for networking with people in her company and approaching HR for advice on her resume. Also looked at how to find work history of others on LinkedIn and people from Brandeis on brandeisconnect.  Looked at where other software engineers are working in the Boston area.

Has been serving for 3 years as strategic advisor - like military consulting.  Took officers course.  Extended to gov/t/public relations.  has also been helping a friend with his business - strategic advising, brand  positioning, and customer segmentation.  

Management consulting - Some of the best people are people who came in from private sector - understand innovation, how to put ideas into practice.
But hasn't explored defense consulting.

Struggling with:  Finished army in July.  hasn't done traditional econ.  Not sure how to prep for interviews.

Also - what opportunities is he overlooking? 

day to day - what gov't wants IDF to do - gov't has direction of where they want to go, and they break up the issues and translate to operational planning.  Described what Mathew K. did at Brunswick Group.  He agrees that he has been looking at strategic communications.  Also mentioned PR for the government.  

Other avenues to get that business acumen, or build narrative on the way to an MBA.  I will follow up with Hardik and get back to him.  ",,4/23/2025,11:00 AM,This is a semester name that should get replaced,

My name is Josh and I am an undergraduate alumni of Brandeis.

I am currently at a bit of a career crossroads and could use some assistance finding a path forward. I have been in operations in the musical instrument realm for ten years at this point and I semi-recently earned an MBA from SNHU. I am at a point where I'd like to jump outside of the music industry, but I am not sure exactly what I'm looking for.

I have been fairly successful getting interviews and interviewing over the past couple of months and I was particularly interested in a job at Simon & Schuster doing paper procurement. I had gotten to the last round only to be beaten out by another candidate despite positive feedback, and now I'm unclear on how to proceed with my job search.

Please see my resume and cover letter attached. I would love to discuss things further and try to get some clarity on what I should be doing or what I should be looking for.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Would prefer to be remote - would like flexibility in case his family moves.  Currently in NY.  Open to in person.  
Issues - amount of work, what he is getting out of the job does not align...  He is responsible for operations of 3 different brands. It's too much!  
Doesn't think there is a lot of options for him in this industry at in this type 

Suggest to him to consider if he is looking for the right role - he might not be.  Suggested looking up roles with skills he prefers to use on OOH and O*net.  

One of the things he liked about Simon & Schuster is that he would be doing one thing.  It was a lot, but felt manageable.  He is not interested in a position there he would be like his supervisor.  Also does not want to work in retail.

Good at Excel, data analysis.  Suggested that he consider what he DOES want to do, and whether that exists in the music industry or elsewhere:  
Expand your thoughts to other types of companies in your industry outside of retail.
Radio
Streaming
Theater
Music production
Entertainment in general

He will make a follow up when ready.

His networking goal - a call every day, reaching out 20 ppl/day.  Focusing on Brandeisians and other people who have similar experience/interests
Wants to learn how to be a better networker, and professionally social.
Concerned he might be too polite, has a ""boundary"".  
He has been reaching out through LinkedIn - connects, then reaches out.  Has 1000 connections.  Sometimes being quirky works.
It's harder to get people who don't have things in common with him to respond.  

Discussed objective of building rapport, quality over quantity.  Validated his boundaries, and also suggested that building rapport is about reciprocal sharing.  Invited him to think about what he wants to share with others, how they can get to know him so that they can provide him with tailored advice.  Also discussed etiquette for engaging with professionals at work.

Beyond networking, we had a little time to discuss looking ahead.  He does not want to work at a large company.  Suggested that he keep an eye on Brandeis Collections.  Again, suggested networking at companies to ask about hiring timelines.

I explained to him that PhD programs are usually related to the specific research issue he wants to pursue, and therefore searching for a school is largely based on the professors he wants to work with (based on what they are studying and how it relates to his area of focus).
